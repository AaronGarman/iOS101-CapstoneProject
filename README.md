## Overview

### Description

**Basketball Shot Tracker** is an app that allows users to track statistics about their basketball shooting workouts. This includes allowing users to log entries about their shooting workouts and see statistics about their performance and progress.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Sports
- **Mobile:** Would be able to access it on the court.
- **Story:** More specific than the other two, but would be useful to target audience.
- **Market:** Basketball players, so smaller than other two.
- **Habit:** Would motivate players to achieve higher numbers in their made shots.
- **Scope:** Basic app would at least show shooting percentages, but more types of statisitics could be shown in the future.

#### Post Sprint 1 Update

Was able to create all of the above features, no major errors were encountered. The framework for sprint 2 has been laid out, which I will do this week. My first goal will be to create the screen that allows users to create entries, and once that is complete I will focus on building the stats and details screens after. I would like to be able to implement some of the stretch features like updating and deleting entries if time permits.
