### Description

**Basketball Shot Tracker** is an app that allows users to track statistics about their basketball shooting workouts. This includes allowing users to log entries about their shooting workouts and see statistics about their performance and progress.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Sports
- **Mobile:** Would be able to access it on the court.
- **Story:** More specific than the other two, but would be useful to target audience.
- **Market:** Basketball players, so smaller than other two.
- **Habit:** Would motivate players to achieve higher numbers in their made shots.
- **Scope:** Basic app would at least show shooting percentages, but more types of statisitics could be shown in the future.
